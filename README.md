The motivation behind this repository is to learn more about how a virtual machine works.

## What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine is a program that acts like a computer. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. VMs are useful executing code in a secure or isolated way.

## What computer architecture are we going to simulate in our vm?

Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the [LC-3 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3). LC-3 commonly used in educational institutions to teach students how to program in assembly language. It features a simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs.
